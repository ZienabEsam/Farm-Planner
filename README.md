# Farm-Planner
This project is an end-to-end AI-powered farm planning and management system that leverages machine learning and deep learning to support farmers with real-time insights and decision-making tools.
The system includes:

# Drought and Flood Prediction using classification models trained on NASA POWER climate data.

# Plant Disease Detection through image processing and deep learning (CNN-based classification).

# Low-Code Mobile App built on Thunkable to deliver real-time alerts, predictions, and personalized recommendations directly to farmers.
