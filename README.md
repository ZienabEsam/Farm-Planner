# Farm-Planner
*Overview:* Led a cross-functional team in building an AI-powered system for farm planning and management, building an AI model for drought and food detection, and early plant disease detection using image processing and deep learning, with a companion mobile app to support farmers through real-time insights and notifications.
*Key Contributions:*
Oversaw the entire project lifecycle, coordinating tasks for AI model development and integration of mobile applications.
Held regular 1:1 meetings to follow up on progress and provide guidance on technical tasks.
Oversaw the design and training of the deep learning model, ensuring high-quality prediction through proper preprocessing.
Supervised the development of a low-code mobile application.
*Details:*
This project is an end-to-end AI-powered farm planning and management system that leverages machine learning and deep learning to support farmers with real-time insights and decision-making tools.
The system includes:

Drought and Flood Prediction using classification models trained on NASA POWER climate data.

Plant Disease Detection through image processing and deep learning (CNN-based classification).

Low-Code Mobile App built on Thunkable to deliver real-time alerts, predictions, and personalized recommendations directly to farmers.
